trMA.Kontakion1.text = "He who closed the abyss is seen as dead; As a mortal the Deathless one, Wrapped in spice and linen, Is laid within a grave. Women came to anoint Him, Wailing bitter, crying out, “Exceeding blessed is this Sabbath, On which the Christ has slumbered, To rise on the third day.”"

trMA.Oikos1.text = "He who holds all things together is raised upon a Cross, And all creation mourns beholding this One hung Naked on a Tree. The sun hid its beams, And the stars withheld their shine. The earth, full-feared, was shaken, And the sea has fled away. The rocks were split asunder, And the graves of scores were opened, And the forms of holy men arose. Hades groans below, Yet Jewish men plan to slander The resurrection of Christ. And the women cry aloud, “Exceeding blessed is this Sabbath, On which the Christ has slumbered, To rise on the third day.”"
