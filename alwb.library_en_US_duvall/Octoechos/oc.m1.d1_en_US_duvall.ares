ocMA.Oikos.text = "Let us extol, as omnipotent God, the One who rose on the third day, and who smashed the gates of Hades, and who raised from the tomb those who were there from all time, and who was seen by the myrrh-bearing women as He so willed, uttering to them first of all the greeting, Rejoice, and to the Apostles declaring the joy, as the only Giver of life. Therefore in faith the women announce to the Disciples the tokens of victory. And Hades groans, and Death laments, and the world exults and all people rejoice together. For You, O Christ, are He who grants resurrection to all."
