ocMA.Oikos.text = "The women heard the Angel’s words, and put off their lament, becoming joyful. With trembling they looked upon the Resurrection. And behold, Christ came to them, saying, “Rejoice; take courage. I have overcome the world and have freed the prisoners. Go quickly to the Disciples and inform them, that I go before you to preach in the city of Galilee.” Therefore we all cry out to You, Save us, O Lord."
