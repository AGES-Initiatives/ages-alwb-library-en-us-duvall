ocMA.Oikos.text = "Your cross and tomb, O Life-giver, we believers worship and sing praise; * for Hell, O You who live forever, as almighty God You have belayed. * The gates of Hell You tore to shreds, and as God, the might of death have razed. * So, avidly we earthborn praise * in doxology the One now raised, * who destroyed the deadly power of our foe. * You have resurrected everyone -- all those who believe in You; * You have rescued the world from the serpentâ€™s fangs, and have snatched us from allure to the hostile one -- as alone You had ability to do. * Hence we piously sing the praises of Your rising, by which You saved us, * as the God of all things."
