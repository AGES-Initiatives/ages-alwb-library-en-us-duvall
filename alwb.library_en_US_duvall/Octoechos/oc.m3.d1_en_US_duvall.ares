ocMA.Oikos.text = "Let heaven and earth dance for joy today, and in oneness of mind extol Christ God, for He resurrected the prisoners from their tombs. All creation rejoices together, offering worthy songs to the Creator of all and our Redeemer, for today as the Giver of Life, having drawn mortals up from Hades, He exalts them to heaven together, and lays a curse on the enemyâ€™s haughtiness, and smashes the gates of Hades, by the divine power of His authority."
