ocMA.Oikos.text = "You are the light of those in darkness, You are the resurrection of all and the life of mortals, and with yourself You resurrected everyone, O Savior, despoiling the dominion of death, and smashing the gates of Hades, O Word. The mortals, beholding the miracle, marvelled, and all creation rejoices in Your Resurrection, O Lover of mankind. Therefore we all glorify and extol Your condescension; O my Savior, and the world ever sings Your praise."
