ocMA.Oikos.text = "To Him who from the dead arose, Christ the Life-Giver, on the third day from the tomb; who crushed the gates of death today by the power which is His; who slew Hades and ground away the sting of death, and rescued Adam and Eve: to Him let us all, born on earth, now sing, earnestly shouting our grateful praise. For He, alone our mighty God, on the third day arose, as the Master of all."
