ocMA.Oikos.text = "The netherworld below was trembling today -- Hades and Death before One of the Trinity. The earth was convulsing; and the wardens of hell, seeing You, cowered in fear, yet creation all, rejoicing with the Prophets, sings an ode of triumph to You, our Redeemer and God, who now has destroyed the power of Death. To Adam and to those who were born of him let us shout in triumph and cry aloud, “A Tree has brought this man back in. Come out, you faithful, to the Resurrection.”"
