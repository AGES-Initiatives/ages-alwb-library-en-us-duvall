ocMA.Oikos.text = "Having plundered the realms of Hades and raised the dead, O Longsuffering, You met the Myrrh-bearing women and gave them joy instead of sorrow. And Your Apostles You informed of the symbols of victory, my life-giving Savior, and You illumined creation, O Lover of man. Therefore the world also rejoices, for Your rising from the dead, O Most-Merciful."
