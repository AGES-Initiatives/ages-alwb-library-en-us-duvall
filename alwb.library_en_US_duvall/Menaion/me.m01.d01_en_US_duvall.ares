So come, and let us stand in the house of God, gazing ardently, and be thrilled by his miracles. And when their lustrous light has made us also shine, * let us be warmed by the purifying spirit of his life, imitating his faith, ardor, and humility, through which he became the house of the true God. And let us extol him and cry out to him: O devout Basil, Revealer of heaven to all."
