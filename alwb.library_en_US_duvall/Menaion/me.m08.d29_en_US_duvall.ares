Therefore, mourn, O Herodias, who asked for unlawful murder: The law of God, nor the living age did she love, but one contrived and fleeting."

meMA.Oikos1.text = "Herod's birthday festivities seemed to all unhallowed, for in the midst of the debauchers, the head of the Faster was like a meaty dish presented. Sadness joined to joy, and with laughter, wailing bitter blended; for as the girl entered in before all, bearing on a platter the brow of the Baptist through mad desire, as it says, lamentation fell likewise on the king and all the banqueters. For it did not delight them, nor Herod himself, it says; and they were dampened with a sadness that wasn't real, but one contrived and fleeting."
