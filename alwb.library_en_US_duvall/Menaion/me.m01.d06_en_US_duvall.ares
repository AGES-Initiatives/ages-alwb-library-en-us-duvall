meMA.Oikos1.text = "On Galilee of the Gentiles, on the region of Zebulon and the land of Nephthalim, as the Prophet declared, a great light has shone, which is the Christ. Dark-dwellers have seen a radiant dawn shining out of Bethlehem, rather out of Mary, as the Lord -- the Sun of Justice -- breaks His rays oâ€™er the whole of civilization. Come then, all unclothed offspring of Adam: let us put on Christ and thus keep warm. For, as a mantle for the denuded and a beacon to the be-darkened, You came and shone forth, O Light unapproachable."
