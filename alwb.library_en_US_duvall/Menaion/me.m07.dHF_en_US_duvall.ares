meMA.Oikos1.text = "Let us hear the Church of God crying out with a loud proclamation, \"Let the thirsty come and drink. The bowl that I hold is a bowl of wisdom. I have mixed its drink with the word of truth, and it pours out not water of Contention, but of Confession.\" Imbibing this confession, the actual Israel sees God who says, \"See, see that I AM, and I am not altered. I am God first and I am thereafter, and aside from Me there is no other at all.\" Hence will partakers be filled, and they will praise the great mystery of piety."
