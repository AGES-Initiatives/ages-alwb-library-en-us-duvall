peMA.Oikos1.text = "Speedy and constant consolation give us, Your servants, O Jesus, when our spirits become despondent. Do not part from our souls when we are in trouble, nor be far from our minds when we are in peril. But draw near to us, draw near, O You who are everywhere. And as You are always with Your Apostles, so also unite yourself to us who long for You the Compassionate; so that united to You we may extol and glorify Your all-holy Spirit."
